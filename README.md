# PunkBeers
List and show beer details using [Punk API](https://punkapi.com).

## Running the Project
Just to make it easier, I've chosen to add Pods directory to the repo, so you don't need to have cocoapods installed nor run pod install

- Open `PagseguroTest.xcworkspace`
- Build & run.

## Third-Party Libraries Used

- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - HTTP networking library.
- [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD) - Activity Indicator to show progress to user.
- [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) - Image loading and caching library.
